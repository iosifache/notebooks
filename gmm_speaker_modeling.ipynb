    "For computing the false acceptance rate (FAR) and the false recognition rate (FRR), the scaled score was binarized considering the threshold deduced from the previous section. So, FAR is computed by dividing the number of accepted unauthorized users (that are not the user for whom the model was created, namely not `EVALUATED_SPEAKER`) by the number of unauthorized users in the test dataset. Also, the FRR is the division between the number of rejected authorized users (that are the user for whom the model was created, namely `EVALUATED_SPEAKER`) and the number of authorized users in the test dataset.\n",

In this manner, the samples from the dataset produced by him are assigned with `1` and the others with `0`. Next, the false-positive rates (FPR) and the false negative rates (FNR) are computed and fed into a plotting function."
